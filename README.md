# balance-fetcher-service
This is a basic service written using html, JavaScript and NodeJs to get balance for a wallet address. 
This is created for Solana hackathon and it is created at the last minute since I got to know about this late. I wanted to explore the Solana APIs and thus I developed this tool.

# Instructions to setup
1. npm install
2. npm start

# Instructions to use
1. Open the UI page at http://localhost:5000
2. Get the wallet balance by using the wallet address from MainNet.
